# PortableApps.com Ukraine Suite
PortableApps.com's software platform has been combined with a set of useful apps in an effort to help the 4 million Ukrainian refugees of the Russian invasion. The suite will allow the installation and use of the LibreOffice office suite, Firefox web browser, Thunderbird email client, KeePass password manager, Qmmp media player, and Telegram secure  messaging in either Ukrainian or Russian langugage on any Windows PC. The apps exist separately from traditionally installed Windows apps and can be installed and used from the PC's local storage, an external storage device like a USB flash drive or external hard drive, or within a synced cloud folder.
## Download
The latest versions of the Ukrainian and Russian language versions of the suite are available from the Releases link to the right.
## Installation
Run the PortableApps.com_Ukraine_Suite_Setup_2022.04_XXX.paf.exe installer and select the language you would like to use during installation. The suite will be installed in the language you downloaded regardless of the language you select, allowing a host family or friend to set the suite up without needing to read Ukrainian or Russian.
## Use
To use the suite of apps, run Start.exe from where you installed it. All existing apps will be kept up to date and additional free apps can be installed from the app store.
